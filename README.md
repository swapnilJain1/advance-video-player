# Video Player App

This project is a TypeScript-based video player application. It allows users to view meeting recordings along with their corresponding VTT (Web Video Text Tracks) files. As the video progresses, the equivalent VTT conversation will be highlighted. Additionally, the app provides features for dynamically displaying headings based on the video's content and flagging important conversations.
